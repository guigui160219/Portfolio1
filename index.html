                    My name is Guillaume Devillers, and I am a student in industrial IT. Over the years, I have gained
                    valuable experience in customer service through various student jobs since the age of 16. These
                    roles have helped me develop essential professional skills such as responsibility, time management,
                    and, most importantly, adaptability.

                    In terms of education, I completed my secondary school studies in an English immersion program,
                    which has enabled me to become fluent in the language. I am particularly passionate about full-stack
                    web development, and my long-term ambition is to contribute to an organization where I can grow both
                    personally and professionally. I aspire to take on challenges that allow me to collaborate with
                    dynamic teams, develop innovative solutions, and improve operational efficiencies.

                    I highly value commitment, teamwork, and continuous learning. I believe work should be approached
                    with determination, while remaining open to constructive feedback and collaboration to foster
                    personal and professional growth. I come from a close-knit family with strong values of hard work
                    and mutual support. Growing up, my family instilled in me the importance of education,
                    responsibility, and independence. These values have shaped my worldview and cultivated a deep
                    appreciation for diverse perspectives, collaboration, and empathy.

                            During my first year of my bachelor degree, I've been asked to achieve a group project.
                            After some brainstorming and time management we've decided to do a project centered around a
                            car track. The goal was straightforward: every time the car crossed the finish line, a
                            sensor would sent an update to a program which was running on our laptop.

                            This signal had several purpose, such as save the lap time and increase the lap counter. To
                            ensure smooth progress, we divided the tasks among team members based on our individual
                            strengths and interests. I primarily handled the electronics because I felt more comfortable
                            working with physical components at that time. This involved setting up and connecting
                            sensors to ensure they functioned correctly with the car track.

                            Meanwhile, other team members focused on the coding aspect, which involved writing a program
                            to process the sensor signals. Since I didn’t feel confident in coding back then, I
                            preferred to leave that task to someone more skilled. During this project I've learned to
                            use eletronical parts such as the different sensors and also master how to code in C
                            language.

                            Through this project, I learned to work with various electronic components, such as
                            different types of sensors. I also gained experience coding in C, which was new and
                            challenging for me. Additionally, this project gave me my first experience working in a
                            team, as I had never had to collaborate with others in this way before. The time management
                            was also crucial certainly the more crucial aspect to handle especially in first year.

                            Overall, this experience taught me technical skills and a great teamwork.

                            This project was a duo collaboration where my partner and I worked on a golf ball sorting
                            system. The project involved significant electronic components, such as sensors and a smart
                            AI camera (HuskyLens), along with web-based interactions. The system tracked the number and
                            color of golf balls that passed through and maintained a historical log for monitoring
                            purposes. Additionally, we had to design and build a physical structure to house all the
                            electronic components effectively.

                            My contributions focused on web development, building the physical structure, and managing
                            the team and time. I actively developed the website interface, which allowed users to
                            interact with the system and access the logs. Designing the structure was another key
                            responsibility, ensuring it was robust and functional for the electronic setup. While my
                            coworker primarily handled the coding, I remained involved to understand the programming
                            aspects better and enhance my knowledge in this area.

                            Throughout this project, I significantly improved my time management and organizational
                            skills. Balancing responsibilities within tight deadlines required strategic planning and
                            prioritization. I also learned the importance of effective communication and delegation,
                            ensuring that both of us leveraged our strengths to complete tasks efficiently.
                            This experience not only strengthened my technical expertise, particularly in web
                            development and structural design, but also provided personal growth. Working
                            collaboratively taught me adaptability and how to maintain focus under pressure. Observing
                            and contributing to the coding efforts expanded my understanding of programming, which will
                            benefit me in future projects.

                            Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding. It enhanced my practical skills,
                            boosted my confidence in teamwork, and emphasized the importance of combining technical
                            abilities with effective collaboration to achieve shared goals.

                            For this project, I was tasked with designing and developing a solution on my own. I decided
                            to create a cocktail dispenser that can dispense the perfect amount of liquor for a balanced
                            cocktail, either by pressing a button or by touching a tile on a mobile application. The
                            first step in the process was to fully develop the mobile application, which was essential
                            for controlling the dispenser. After completing the app, I started working on the physical
                            structure of the project.

                            Throughout this process, I learned how to integrate various components into my project, such
                            as pressure sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and other essential electronics. One of the biggest
                            challenges I faced was finding time to work on the project alongside my lessons at school.
                            This forced me to improve my time management skills and prioritize my work more effectively.
                            Additionally, I had the opportunity to enhance my technical abilities. I gained experience
                            in reading technical datasheets, which helped me understand the specifications and
                            capabilities of different components. I also learned how to code an ESP8266 and create a
                            fully interactive mobile app. The outcomes of this project extended beyond just technical
                            skills; it also taught me the importance of self-discipline and hard work. Overall, the
                            project was a valuable learning experience that helped me grow both personally and
                            professionally.

                            During my third year of my bachelor’s program, I was tasked with a project within a
                            "mini-usine" that involved collaboration with partners. The goal was to develop a website
                            using the T3 app framework, which integrated a websocket to acquire real-time data from the
                            working zone. Once the data was acquired, it was displayed on graphs and organized into
                            various cards based on their respective categories. The project also required the creation
                            of a database to store historical data of the working zone.

                            In parallel, I worked on integrating a VR headset to display this data in an immersive
                            environment. This aspect of the project was both challenging and rewarding, as I had to
                            learn and adapt to the complexities of VR development.

                            Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating a fully responsive website,
                            showcasing multiple pages with specific information. Additionally, working with VR
                            technology allowed me to expand my knowledge in a new field, offering a deeper understanding
                            of both web and immersive development. This experience not only improved my technical skills
                            but also enhanced my problem-solving and collaboration abilities, as I worked closely with
                            my team to overcome the challenges we faced.
